## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This repository is a **library of code snippets** for my personal use. It includes random fragments of code that I might need to reference later or that I find useful during my development work. The snippets cover a variety of programming languages and technologies, including but not limited to:

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**

Some snippets are self-explanatory, while others might require additional context or research. The purpose of this repository is to help me quickly access useful code Iâ€™ve encountered over time.
